## 🎤 Talking Points

### Opening Hook

### Demo Transition
"Let me show you how it works. This is a real bank scam transcript..."

### Technical Credibility
"We use three AI models working together: a machine learning classifier trained on thousands of scam calls, an anomaly detector for unusual transaction patterns, and a multi-factor risk engine that weighs all evidence."

### Impact Statement
"This isn't just about money. It's about protecting vulnerable people from emotional trauma and financial ruin. One prevented scam pays for years of our service."

### Call to Action
"We're ready to pilot with financial institutions and telecom providers. Our API can integrate in days, not months."
